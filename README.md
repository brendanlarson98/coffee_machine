# coffee_machine
## Written in Procedural Programming and Object Oriented Programming to show a dichotomy between the two styles

## Here we create the code to run a coffee machine with three options: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. These are created in dictionaries which define how much milk, water, and coffee is used to make them, as well as the cost to purchase. Inside the program, we can order each one of these, run a report to see how many resources we have at our disposal, and refill each resource when they get low. We will also calculate change for purchases which use too much money, and deny service to those who offer too little money.

## Takeaway, with Procedural Programming, which is function based, our code becomes much more complex, with nested functions and networked calls. Object Oriented programming allows us to write neater and more controlled programs. With OOP, we create three different classes which help us organize our functions and dictionaries with each applicable object.
